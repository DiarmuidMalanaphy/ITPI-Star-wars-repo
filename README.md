Goal: Create a minimal api in C# that saves a list of favourite Star Wars planets.

The API Should:

    GET a list of Planets from the SWAPI API (https://swapi.dev)
    GET a list of favourite Planets
    POST a favourite Planet and save to an in memory entity framework database - Planets can only be favourited once.
    DELETE a favourite planet.

Bonus Task:

    GET a random planet that has not yet been favourited from the SWAPI API. (https://swapi.dev)
